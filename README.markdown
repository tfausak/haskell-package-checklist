# Haskell package checklist

This post covers everything you need to know about developing a Haskell
package. I wrote it because I made a few packages and nothing covers the entire
process. The [Cabal user guide][1] provides good low-level information, and
Sebastiaan Visser's [Towards a better Haskell package][2] gives some nice
high-level guidance. This post covers both of those and fills in some of the
gaps left by them.

- **Use Git for source control.** If it's not in source control, it doesn't
  exist. Git is the most popular choice, but its interface can be difficult to
  understand. Consider using a GUI like GitHub Desktop.

- **Host on GitHub.** GitHub allows other developers to easily contribute to
  your package. Compared to other hosts, you are more likely to receive
  contributions. Also GitHub integrates nicely with many other services.

- **Build with Stack.** Stack painlessly manages Haskell dependencies. It
  installs GHC for you and ensures you get a build plan that actually works. If
  your package builds today, Stack ensures it will continue to build tomorrow.

- **Define with hpack.** The default Cabal package file format is custom,
  tedious, and verbose. hpack uses YAML and avoids unnecessary boilerplate.
  Stack integrates hpack to automatically convert your `package.yaml` into a
  `*.cabal` file when necessary.

- **Name with kebab-case.** Keep everything lowercase to avoid confusion. You
  don't want people trying to install `http` when they really meant `HTTP`. Use
  hyphens to separate words, but keep it short and memorable. Nobody wants to
  type out `hypertext-transfer-protocol`.

- **Use Semantic Versioning.** Unfortunately Hackage recommends the Package
  Versioning Policy. The PVP adds ambiguity by using two major version numbers.
  That encourages packages to stay on major version 0, which doesn't inspire
  confidence. Many other languages use Semantic Versioning. SemVer matches how
  developers generally think about version numbers.

- **License your package.** Nobody can use a package without a license. The
  most popular license for Haskell is BSD 3-Clause, followed by MIT. Whichever
  license you choose, include the license file in your package.

- **Write a README.** Most people will familiarize themselves with your package
  by reading your README. It should describe the problem that your package
  solves. Be sure to include at least one concrete example in it. GitHub will
  automatically format your `README.markdown`.

- **Keep a change log.** Most packages will use Git tags to mark releases, but
  reading diffs is not an acceptable way for users to discover changes. Put a
  human-readable summary of changes in the GitHub releases. Then link to that
  from your `CHANGELOG.markdown`.

- **Write a `synopsis`.** This shows up when searching and viewing your
  package. Keep it short, imperative, and descriptive. Also write a
  `description`, which can be pretty much the same as the `synopsis`. For
  example:

      name:        aeson
      synopsis:    Encode and decode JSON.
      description: Aeson encodes and decodes JSON.

- **Avoid heavy dependencies.** Only add a dependency if your package needs it
  to function. Don't include stuff that's just nice to have. For example, you
  should probably avoid `lens` even though it makes code easier to write. In
  addition to avoiding heavy dependencies, you should avoid having too many
  dependencies. Think about how long it would take to install your package
  starting from scratch.

- **Include `extra-source-files`.** If a file is necessary for your package to
  build, it belongs in `extra-source-files`. This includes files that tests and
  benchmarks need. You should also include package metadata like your README
  and change log. Note that you don't need to include your license file if your
  package's `license-file` is set.

- **Fix package warnings.** Stack prints these out when you run `stack sdist`.
  You should fix all of them, even though some aren't that useful. For
  instance, Stack warns you if you don't set a category even though the
  categories on Hackage aren't that useful. To fix warnings about version
  bounds, consider using `--pvp-bounds=both`.

- **Put Haskell files in `source/`.** In other words, separate your package
  metadata from actual source files. This makes it easy to write scripts that
  work on every Haskell file, like formatting or counting lines of code. The
  exact names aren't important, but you should end up with a structure like
  this:

  - `source/library/YourPackage.hs`
  - `source/executables/Main.hs`
  - `source/tests/Main.hs`

- **Match package and module names.** If your package is named `tasty-burrito`,
  you should have a top-level module called `TastyBurrito`. Avoid the
  unnecessary module hierarchy like `Data.ByteString` or
  `Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec`. While the package name uses `kebab-case`,
  module names should use `CamelCase`.

- **Require one import.** Users should be able to get started with nothing more
  than `import YourPackage`. If necessary, re-export stuff from other packages.
  Design for qualified imports; don't be afraid to take common names like
  `singleton`.

- **Expose implementation details.** People will want to use your package in
  ways you didn't think of. Make everything public, but not necessarily part of
  your published API. Use `Internal` module names like `Data.Text.Internal` to
  signal that things aren't published.

- **Build `-Wall` clean.** GHC finds all kinds of problems with `-Wall`. Few of
  them are false positives and they generally help you write better code. But
  if you don't like one, disable it with `-fno-warn-whatever`. Be sure to use
  `stack build --pedantic` when developing your package. It will force you to
  fix warnings.

- **Follow most HLint suggestions.** Overall HLint is a great tool for
  improving code quality. However some suggestions aren't worth following. For
  example, the re-export shortcut suggestion breaks the Haddock documentation.
  Use your own judgment when deciding which suggestions to follow.

- **Format code with hindent.** hindent is the closest thing we have to a
  community style. Using it frees you from ever thinking about formatting
  again. If you don't like how something looks, fix it in hindent and
  everyone's formatting will improve. Using hindent also avoids pointless
  arguments about style in pull requests.

- **Write documentation with examples.** Types are not a substitute for
  documentation. Neither are laws. Usually functions are added to solve a
  specific problem. Show that problem in the documentation as an example.

- **Test with Tasty using Hspec.** Tasty provides a framework for running
  different kinds of tests with the same command line interface. It handles
  randomizing the test order, selecting which tests to run, and displaying
  their output. Hspec provides a library for writing human-readable tests. Use
  other testing libraries like QuickCheck when they make sense.

- **Run tests on Travis CI.** Travis CI is free for open source projects and
  integrates with GitHub. Every time you push a commit to GitHub, Travis CI
  will run your test suite. This makes it easy to keep your package buildable.
  By default Travis CI runs on Linux, but you can also run on macOS. If you
  want to run your test suite on Windows, consider using AppVeyor.

- **Keep executables small.** If your package provides an executable, define it
  in your library and re-export it. This allows other packages to use your
  executable's behavior from Haskell. Your executable should look like this:

      module Main (module YourPackage) where
      import YourPackage (main)

- **Benchmark with Criterion.** If your package needs to be fast, Criterion is
  the best tool for measuring it. On the other hand if your package doesn't
  need to be fast, there's no sense in maintaining benchmarks for it.

- **Automate releases.** Don't manually create distribution tarballs and upload
  them to Hackage. Instead, get Travis CI to do it. Travis CI sets the
  `TRAVIS_TAG` environment variable. If that's set, you can run
  `stack upload .` to upload your package. Travis CI will need your Hackage
  credentials, so be sure not to leak those into the build log.

If you're looking for a starting point that ticks most of these boxes, consider
my [Haskeleton][3] Stack template. It will give you a good base to start from.
If you're looking for an actual package that follows the guidelines, check out
[Rattletrap][4], my Rocket League replay parser and generator. It can show you
exactly how some of these things are implemented.
